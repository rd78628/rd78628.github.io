	<h2>Summary of Website</h2>
	<p class="sources"> This website is dedicated to outlining how and if building
	a colony on Mars is a viable option for humanity. It will begin by comparing
	conditions on Earth and Mars, then talking about how we can build the colony on
	Mars, and then finally end by talking about the results of building a colony there.

		<div style='float:center'><p class="sources1">As you can see there are very big differences
		between Earth and Mars, one of the biggest of which is the huge difference in oxygen and water percentage.
		Given that oxygen and water are neccessary for humans to live, the first and foremost challenge would be to
		figure out a way to create oxygen and water on Mars. There is water on Mars, but it is frozen in underground
		pool, so we would have to figure out a way to bring it to the surface. The vitual non-existence of nitrogen 
		also causes a big concern since the element is essential in order for a planet to have an ecosystem, which Mars
		currently does not.</p>
		<p class="sources1"> The surface temperature offers similarities to Earth, however the problem is in the fact
		that Mars experiences temperature changes much more frequently than Earth does.</p>

	into the atmosphere, and many others. So instead of going through each of them, here is a
